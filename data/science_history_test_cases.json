She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences (Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911), and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice. Curie discovered two elements: polonium, which she named after her native country Poland, and radium. Her work with radioactive materials eventually led to her death from aplastic anemia in 1934, likely caused by prolonged exposure to radiation. Despite the dangers, her discoveries laid the groundwork for advances in nuclear physics and medical treatments.",

Key legal concepts developed by Roman jurists include 'innocent until proven guilty,' the right to face one's accuser, and the distinction between laws of nature and laws of nations. The Corpus Juris Civilis, compiled under Emperor Justinian in the 6th century CE, systematically organized Roman legal principles and became the foundation for civil law systems used today in continental Europe, Latin America, and many other regions. Common law countries like England and the United States, while developing different legal traditions, still incorporated many Roman legal principles.",

    "passage": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI systems can be categorized as either narrow AI or general AI. Narrow AI, also called weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks and is what exists today in applications like voice assistants, recommendation algorithms, and facial recognition software. General AI, or strong AI, would possess human-like cognitive abilities across diverse tasks and remains theoretical. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming. Deep learning, a further subset using artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain, has driven recent AI breakthroughs. While AI offers tremendous benefits including medical diagnosis improvements, autonomous vehicles, and enhanced productivity, concerns exist about job displacement, privacy, bias in algorithms, and the need for ethical AI development frameworks.",

    "rubric": "Definition: 0 points - does not define AI, 1 point - vague definition about computer intelligence, 2 points - clearly defines AI as computer systems performing tasks requiring human intelligence with examples (perception, recognition, decision-making, translation). Categories: 0 points - does not mention categories, 1 point - mentions narrow and general AI without explanation, 2 points - explains narrow AI performs specific tasks and exists today, while general AI would have human-like cognitive abilities and is theoretical. Concerns: 0 points - does not mention concerns, 1 point - mentions one concern vaguely, 2 points - identifies multiple specific concerns like job displacement, privacy, algorithmic bias, or need for ethical frameworks.",
    "answer": "AI is computer systems that do intelligent tasks like humans do, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and translating languages. There are two main types: narrow AI which performs specific tasks and exists in things like voice assistants and facial recognition, and general AI which would have human-like abilities but doesn't exist yet. AI raises concerns about job losses, privacy issues, bias in algorithms, and the need for ethical guidelines.",

    "passage": "The water crisis refers to the global situation where available fresh water resources are insufficient to meet demand. Although 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, only 2.5% is fresh water, and most of that is locked in glaciers and ice caps. Less than 1% of the world's fresh water is readily accessible for human use. The crisis manifests in several ways: physical water scarcity affects regions like the Middle East and North Africa where water resources are insufficient for population needs; economic water scarcity occurs where water exists but infrastructure to access it is inadequate, common in sub-Saharan Africa; and water pollution reduces the amount of safe water available. Contributing factors include population growth, agricultural irrigation (which accounts for 70% of freshwater use), industrial consumption, and climate change affecting precipitation patterns. Solutions require integrated approaches including improved irrigation efficiency, water recycling, desalination technology, better watershed management, and reducing water pollution.",
    "question": "What is the water crisis, what causes it, and what solutions does the passage suggest?",
    "rubric": "Problem Definition: 0 points - does not define the water crisis, 1 point - vaguely mentions water shortage, 2 points - clearly explains fresh water resources are insufficient to meet demand with supporting statistics (2.5% fresh water, less than 1% accessible) or types of scarcity (physical and economic). Causes: 0 points - does not identify causes, 1 point - mentions one cause vaguely, 2 points - identifies multiple specific causes like population growth, agricultural irrigation (70% of use), industrial consumption, pollution, or climate change.

      "criterion_1_reasoning": "You're right that there's not enough water for everyone, which captures the basic idea. However, the passage provides important details that make the problem clearer. Only 2.5% of Earth's water is fresh water, and less than 1% is actually accessible for human use. The passage also describes two types of water scarcity: physical scarcity (not enough water exists) and economic scarcity (water exists but infrastructure to access it is lacking). Including these specifics shows deeper understanding.",
      "criterion_2_score": 1,
      "criterion_2_reasoning": "You mentioned 'people use too much,' which is partially correct but very general. The passage lists specific causes: population growth, agricultural irrigation (which uses 70% of fresh water!), industrial consumption, water pollution, and climate change. Naming at least two or three of these specific factors would make your answer much stronger.",
      "criterion_3_score": 1,
      "criterion_3_reasoning": "You said 'we need to save water,' which is a good general idea but doesn't address the specific solutions in the passage.

Mentioning at least two of these specific solutions would demonstrate that you understood the passage's proposed approaches.",
      "total_score": 3,
      "overall_feedback": "Your answer shows you understand the basic concept - there's a water shortage problem. However, the question asks for three specific things: what the crisis is, what causes it, and what solutions exist. To improve, organize your answer into these three parts and use specific details from the passage. For example: (1) Explain that less than 1% of Earth's water is accessible fresh water. (2) List specific causes like agricultural irrigation using 70% of fresh water, population growth, and pollution. (3) Name specific solutions like improving irrigation efficiency, water recycling, or desalination. These details transform a basic answer into one that demonstrates thorough comprehension.
